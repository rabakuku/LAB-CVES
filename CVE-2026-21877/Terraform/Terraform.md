### How this works:

1. **Static IP Reservation:** It reserves `lab-static-ip` so your IP stays consistent.
2. **Automated Firewall:** It creates the GCP firewall rules automatically so you don't have to do it in the console.
3. **Metadata Startup Script:**
* It installs Docker and Git upon the first boot.
* It uses a special GCP internal URL (`http://metadata.google.internal/...`) to ask the platform "What is my public IP?".
* It uses `sed` to find the `WEBHOOK_URL` in your `docker-compose.yml` and replace whatever is there with the correct IP.
* Finally, it fires up the containers.



### To use this:

1. Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP Project ID.
2. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`.
3. Wait about 2–3 minutes for the startup script to finish (installing Docker takes a moment).
4. Copy the IP from the Terraform output and run your exploit!

Would you like me to add a step to automatically create a "Mitigation" branch or any specific OS optimizations for the VM?
