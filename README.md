Welcome to LAB-CVE, a curated collection of containerized, ready-to-launch labs designed for security researchers, pentesters, and students. This repository provides safe, isolated environments to reproduce, exploit, and mitigate real-world (and hypothetical) CVEs.
🚀 Repository Description

LAB-CVE is an interactive sandbox for exploring the mechanics of high-impact vulnerabilities. By leveraging Docker and n8n, we bridge the gap between reading a security advisory and understanding the exploit chain in a live, orchestrated environment.
✨ Features

    🏗️ Instant Setup: Launch complex multi-service labs with a single docker compose command.

    🧪 Real-World Scenarios: Labs include automation tools (like n8n) to simulate modern Shadow IT and DevOps risks.

    🛠️ Full PoC Included: Every lab comes with a documented Proof of Concept script and a deep-dive manual.

    🧹 Clean Teardown: Test without the mess. Delete your lab instance instantly with no traces left on your host.
